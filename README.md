MARIE.js is an implementation of a simulator for a 'Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy'
from [The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Essentials_of_Computer_Organization.html?id=3kQoAwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) (Linda Null, Julia Lobur) in JavaScript.

## Setup
Latest Stable: [https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js/releases/latest](https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js/releases/latest])

Latest Release: [https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js/archive/master.zip)

This is for web developers who would like to develop, build or deploy the
MARIE.js project. If this is you, then continue reading below.

MARIE.js is essentially a front-end only site with no servers or databases.
The tools we use are `npm` and `grunt`, which makes developing this project
a little easier.

It is recommended that you use a Unix-like operating system to build, test and
run the code. You'll need to install `npm`, then run the following commands to
install dependencies, build the release version, and run a localhost server as
well as opening the default browser directing to the localhost site.

    npm run start
    
## Development
To test and build the development version of MARIE.js, run the following
commands.

    npm run start

    # or if you are using yarn

    yarn start
    
## Building
To build just run

    npm run build

    # or if you are using yarn
    
    yarn build


### Electron Mode
    cd /path/to/repo/MARIE.js
    npm install
    npm install grunt-cli
    npm install electron      //for electron branch
    grunt test # you need JRE 8 for this command
    grunt bar-dev

## Documentation
We use jsdoc for documenting the code. This can be found within the `doc`
folder.

If you want to build the documentation website again (if you have, say, made
some changes to the documentation of the JavaScript code), then run this
command.

    grunt jsdoc
